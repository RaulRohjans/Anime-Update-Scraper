# Anime-Update-Scraper
Python scripts made to fill AnimeWatcher's database with series and episodes from Anime-Update. The scripts are supposed to save the Anime thumbnails, episode information, generate a thumbnail for the episode and store everything in a database.
In case of the "New Anime Scraper", it's intent was to gather information of the new anime releases on the website and store it.

These scripts are very messy as they were never intended to be released to the public. 

Included in the project there is also a batch script that can reset the network stack (Windows only), which refreshes the temporary IPv6 and bypasses Anime-Update's 100 episodes per day limit.

Anyone is free to use any of the code in the script as the project has been abandoned.
